# ArcGIS Platform: Location Services for Developers

> **Technical session description:**: ArcGIS Platform is a geospatial platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for developers that need to integrate location capabilities into their apps, business systems, and products. It also allows developers to create apps and extend ArcGIS products using ArcGIS APIs and SDKs. In this talk, we will go through what's new and what's different between ArcGIS Platform and ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise when developing apps and how your organization might benefit from it.

### Demos

**Store finder**: OSM free services are great, but it has some limitations, for
example heavy usage is not allowed, and some important APIs like address suggestions/autocomplete or routing distances are not available. 
We will see how we can to use ArcGIS Locations Services when needed to use a 
custom basemap and customize add the enhancements listed above.
